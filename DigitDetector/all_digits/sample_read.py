This sample code shows how one can read in our JSON image files in Python3.  It reads in the file and then outputs the two-dimensional array.
It applies a simple threshold test - if value is > threshold then it outputs a '.' otherwise it outputs an 'X'.  More refinement is probably better.
But this is for displaying images not processing or recognizing images."""

Reads in the given JSON file as outlined in the README.txt file.
